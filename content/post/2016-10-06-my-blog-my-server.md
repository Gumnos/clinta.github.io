I haven't written in a while. And part of that has been a growing frustration with blogging on github. I tolerated jekyll, but never loved it, and when github upgraded they took away some of the customizations I had done and I had to sort through the changes before I could publish again. One of the biggest things that broke was syntax highlighting, at least an implementation of it that supported the combination of jinja2 and yaml that I have demonstrations of throughout this blog. Of course I can't blame it all on the platform. I've also just been forgetting to take the opportunity to share useful things when I discover them.

I'll have some new posts coming soon with some of the neat things I've learned setting up this new server. I had great fun in trying to simplify the design as much as reasonable and avoid anything unnecessary. If you pop open developer tools you'll notice that this page has loaded a total of 2 resources. The html and the CSS. There's no images, no javascript, no user tracking or ads, and it's served efficiently and securely. Personally, it's what I think techincal sites should be. Simple, fast and easy to read on a phone when your xorg is broken and you need to lookup instructions for fixing it.
